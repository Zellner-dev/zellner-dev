## You fly from the same height as your dreams.
Hi, my name is Alisson Zellner. 
I am a junior developer.
I work with Flutter, but I like to work with Java Spring and React Js.
I'm 18, my first contact with programing was in 2021.

We can connect and talk in my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisson-zellner-55a1a318a/).

See my best works down here!
